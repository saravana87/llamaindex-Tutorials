In response to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), researchers are expeditiously searching for antiviral treatments 
able to alleviate the symptoms of infection, which can be life-threatening. 
Here, we provide a general overview of what is currently known about the 
structure and characteristic features of SARS-CoV-2, some of which could 
potentially be exploited for the purposes of antiviral therapy and vaccine 
development. This minireview also covers selected and noteworthy antiviral 
agents/supportive therapy out of hundreds of drugs that are being repurposed or 
tested as potential treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
