Rajinikanth
Shivaji Rao Gaikwad[a][4] (born 12 December 1950),
known professionally as Rajinikanth,[b] is an Indian
actor who predominantly works in Tamil cinema.[6] In
a career spanning over five decades, he has done 170
films[c]  that  includes  films  in  Tamil,  Hindi,  Telugu,
Kannada,  Bengali,  and  Malayalam.  He  is  widely
regarded to be one of the most successful and popular
actors in the history of Indian cinema.[7][8][9] Known
for his uniquely styled mannerism and one liners in
films, he has a huge fan base and a cult following. The
Government of India honoured him with the Padma
Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2016,
India's  third  and  second  highest  civilian  honours
respectively, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2019,
the highest Indian award in the field of cinema, for his
contributions  to  Indian  cinema.[10][11]  He  has  won
numerous  film  awards  including  seven  Tamil  Nadu
State  Film  Awards,  a  Nandi  Award,  one  Filmfare
Award and two Maharashtra State Film Awards.
Following his debut in K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil
drama Apoorva Raagangal, Rajinikanth's acting career
commenced  with  a  brief  phase  of  portraying
antagonistic  characters  in  Tamil  films.  His  major
positive role as a scorned lover in S. P. Muthuraman's
Bhuvana  Oru  Kelvi  Kuri  (1977),  1978's  Mullum
Malarum  and  Aval  Appadithan  received  him  critical
acclaim;  the  former  earned  him  a Tamil  Nadu  State
Film Award Special Prize for Best Actor.[12][13] By the
end of the decade, he had worked in all South Indian
film  industries  and  established  a  career  in  Tamil
cinema. He then played dual roles in the action thriller
Billa (1980), a remake of the Hindi film Don (1978). It
was  his  biggest  commercial  success  to  that  point,
earned  him  stardom  and  gave  him  the  action  hero
image.[14] He starred in triple role in Moondru Mugam
(1982), which earned him a special prize at the Tamil
Nadu  State  Film  Awards  ceremony.  The  following
year,  he  made  his  Hindi  film  debut  with  T.  Rama  Rao's  top  grossing  Andhaa  Kaanoon  (1983).[15]
Nallavanukku Nallavan (1984) won him that year's Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor.[16] In the latter
"Rajinikanth  claims  that  I  am  his  school.  But  I
must  admit  that  this  wasn't  the  Rajinikanth  I
introduced. He has evolved on his own merits and
strengths. I gave him an opportunity and unveiled
him to the world. He went and conquered it."
— K. Balachander about Rajinikanth[50]
Upon  completion  of  his  school  education,  Rajinikanth  performed  several  jobs  including  that  of  a
coolie,[39] before getting a job in the Bangalore Transport Service as a bus conductor.[40][41] He continued
to take part in plays after the Kannada playwright Topi Muniappa offered him a chance to act in one of
his mythological plays. He decided to take up an acting course in the newly formed Madras Film Institute
after coming across an advertisement.[42] Although his family was not fully supportive of his decision to
join  the  institute,[42]  his  friend  and  co-worker  Raj  Bahadur  motivated  him  to  join  the  institute  and
financially supported him during this phase.[43][44] During his stay at the institute, he was noticed by the
Tamil film director K. Balachander.[45] Balachander provided Rajinikanth with his stage name to avoid
confusion with fellow actor Sivaji Ganesan, having taken it from a character's name in his earlier film
Major Chandrakanth.[46][47] The director advised him to learn to speak Tamil, a recommendation that
Rajinikanth quickly followed.[48] Although he can read the language, he cannot write in it.[49]
Rajinikanth  began  his  film  career  with  the
Tamil film Apoorva Raagangal (1975), directed
by K. Balachander.[51] He was cast in a small
role  as  the  ex-husband  of  the  female  lead
played  by  Srividya.[51][52][53]  The  film
explored  relationships  between  people  with
wide  age  differences  and  was  deemed
controversial  upon  release.[54]  However,  it
received  critical  acclaim  and  won  three
National Film Awards including the Award for the Best Tamil Feature at the 23rd National Film Awards in
1976.[55] A review from The Hindu noted that, "Newcomer Rajinikanth is dignified and impressive."[56]
His next release was Puttanna Kanagal's Kannada anthology film Katha Sangama (1976).[57] Rajinikanth
appeared in the last segment of the film; he played the role as a village ruffian who rapes a blind woman
in the absence of her husband.[58] Balachander cast him in a pivotal role in Anthuleni Katha (1976), the
Telugu remake of his own Tamil film Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974).[58] In Moondru Mudichu—the first
Tamil film to feature him in a prominent role—he played a character that "blithely row[s] away" when his
friend drowns accidentally in the lake only to fulfill his desire to marry the former's girlfriend.[59] His
style of flipping the cigarette in the film made him popular among the audience.[60] In his final release of
the year, Baalu Jenu, he was cast as the main antagonist who troubles the female lead.[58] He played
similar roles in Balachander's Avargal (1977),[61] and Bharathiraja's 16 Vayadhinile (1977).[58][62] The
same year, he made his first-ever appearance as a lead actor in the Telugu film Chilakamma Cheppindi
(1977), which earned him his only nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[63][64] S.
P. Muthuraman experimented Rajinikanth in a positive role in Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri (1977).[65] The
success of the film brought the duo together for 24 more films till the 1990s.[65] Rajinikanth played
supporting and "villainous" roles in most of the films released during the year.[59] In Gaayathri he was
cast as a pornographer who secretly films his relationship with his wife without her knowledge and in
Galate Samsara he played the role of a married man who develops an affair with a cabaret dancer.[66] He
had 15 of his films released during the year.[67]
Acting career
1974–1977: Early career
In 1978, Rajinikanth had 20 releases across Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.[68][69] His first film of the year
was P. Madhavan's Shankar Salim Simon, in which he was among the three leads. Following that, he co-
starred  alongside  Vishnuvardhan  in  the  Kannada  film  Kiladi  Kittu.  He  played  the  second  lead  in
Annadammula Savaal, which starred Krishna; Rajinikanth reprised his role from the Kannada original.
He then played an important role in the supernatural thriller Aayiram Jenmangal. In Maathu Tappada
Maga, he was the main antagonist. Bairavi, directed by M. Bhaskar, was the first Tamil film to cast
Rajinikanth as a solo hero.[70][71] It was for this film that he earned the sobriquet "Superstar".[71] S.
Thanu, one of the film's distributors, set up a 35 feet (11 m) high cut-out of Rajinikanth.[72] His next
appearance Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu, a quadrangular love story written and directed by C. V. Sridhar,
saw him play the role of a man who sacrifices his love for his friend, played by Kamal Haasan. The film's
success prompted Sridhar to remake the film in Telugu, Vayasu Pilichindi, which retained the original
cast of the Tamil film.[73]
His next film, Vanakkatukuriya Kathaliye, had an introductory song to mark his entry, a trend that would
soon catch on in with his later films.[71] Mullum Malarum, released during the same period, received
critical acclaim, and earned him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil nomination.[74] The film
marked the directional debut of Mahendran, with a screenplay adapted from a novel of the same name
published in Kalki.[71] It won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film and a Special Prize (Best Actor) for
Rajinikanth at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.[71] Following this, he made a foray into Malayalam
cinema with I. V. Sasi's fantasy film Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum, which was based on a story from
the Arabian Nights. The same year, he acted in Dharma Yuddam, in which he played a mentally-ill person
avenging the death of his parents. He then co-starred with N. T. Rama Rao in Tiger. Upon completion of
Tiger, Rajinikanth had acted in 50 films over a period of four years, and in four languages. Some other
popular films released during this period are the youthful entertainer Ninaithale Inikkum, the Tamil–
Kannada bilingual Priya, the Telugu film Amma Evarikkaina Amma and the melodrama Aarilirunthu
Arubathu Varai. Priya, based on a detective novel by Sujatha, had the distinction of being the first film of
Rajinikanth to be shot mostly outside India, mainly in Southeast Asia.[71] Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai
earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil.
Raijinikanth,  who  credited  Hindi  film  star  Amitabh  Bachchan  as  his  inspiration,[75]  began  playing
Amitabh Bachchan's roles in Tamil remakes of his films.[76] This began with Shankar  Salim  Simon
(1978), a remake of Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), followed by Naan Vazhavaippen (1979), a remake of
Majboor (1974).[77] He was subsequently cast in a series of roles modelled after Amitabh Bachchan in
Tamil  remakes  of  his  films.[76]  Rajinikanth  starred  in  eleven  Tamil  remakes  of Amitabh  Bachchan
films,[78] as well as a Telugu remake of Amar Akbar Anthony, Ram Robert Rahim (1980), alongside
Sridevi.[77] The most successful of these were remakes of Salim–Javed films, such as Billa (1980), Thee
(1981) and Mr. Bharath (1986).[78]
During this phase of his career, Rajinikanth abruptly chose to quit acting, but was coaxed to return with
the Tamil film Billa (1980), a remake of the Bollywood blockbuster Don (1978), written by Salim-Javed
and starring Amitabh Bachchan. Billa had Rajinikanth playing dual roles and eventually became his first
solo commercial success.[79][80] His pairing with Sridevi continued in Johnny, where he was once again
cast in a double role, earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. He
also starred in Murattu Kaalai which was a commercial success.[65] The success of Billa was a turning
